You go from short\n\n4\n00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.000\nprompts to fully built and hosted\n\n5\n00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.559\nwebsites in around a minute, maybe two.\n\n6\n00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.400\nAnd let me tell you, I tried so many of\n\n7\n00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.639\nthese tools that claim to do this, but\n\n8\n00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.160\nthis one just works. And when I see\n\n9\n00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.520\nthat, I love to share those on the\n\n10\n00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.800\nchannel. So, we'll get right into this\n\n11\n00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.320\nthree-step process. But before we do\n\n12\n00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.760\nthat, I just want to point out that\n\n13\n00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.840\nTenweb did reach out to sponsor this\n\n14\n00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.760\nvideo. And after trying this, this was a\n\n15\n00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.039\nreally easy call. So, let me show you\n\n16\n00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.720\nthe freestep process. And in this case,\n\n17\n00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.160\nwe'll be building something that I\n\n18\n00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.000\nmyself have procrastinated for way too\n\n19\n00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.079\nlong. A personal website for myself. In\n\n20\n00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.520\nthis day and age, everybody should have\n\n21\n00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.800\none. So, let's get into building a\n\n22\n00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.719\nnative WordPress site here for me. And\n\n23\n00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.640\nyou can do the same for yourself or any\n\n24\n00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.320\none of your projects. Step one, I\n\n25\n00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.079\nbriefly describe what I plan to do here.\n\n26\n00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.079\nI'll give it my name, Eigor Pagani, and\n\n27\n00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.399\nthen continue by saying what I do. Click\n\n28\n00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.320\ngenerate and let the website builder\n\n29\n00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.320\nfigure out what I need here. So, while\n\n30\n00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.760\nthis generates, which should only take a\n\n31\n00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.440\nfew seconds, I want to highlight that,\n\n32\n00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.360\nyeah, you could do this with other AI\n\n33\n00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.039\ntools, but you'll probably get a result\n\n34\n00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.520\nthat is like maybe 70% of the way there,\n\n35\n00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.840\nthis differs. Ah, and this screen right\n\n36\n00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.920\nhere shows you why. Because it starts\n\n37\n00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.600\nwith a website structure rather than\n\n38\n00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.040\njust giving you the full thing. So, I\n\n39\n00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.040\ncould go in here and remove some things\n\n40\n00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.840\nlike resources and success stories.\n\n41\n00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.360\nMatter of fact, for my simple website\n\n42\n00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.040\nhere, I don't even need any of these\n\n43\n00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.960\nsubpages. All I want here in the end is\n\n44\n00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.680\na contact form. can just add that as so.\n\n45\n00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.200\nAnd we're ready to go. I have the\n\n46\n00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.960\nstructure I need here. And that's it for\n\n47\n00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.640\nthe setup part. Now the builder is going\n\n48\n00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.400\nto do its magic, set up a brand new\n\n49\n00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.000\nWordPress website, and we're ready to\n\n50\n00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.680\nmove to phase two. All in the free plan\n\n51\n00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.600\nhere. And there is my first draft with\n\n52\n00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.280\nthe structure that I agreed on. And now\n\n53\n00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.119\nI have the opportunity to edit this. So\n\n54\n00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.040\non my company website in about section,\n\n55\n00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.040\nI already have some details about me and\n\n56\n00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.200\nmy story. So I'll just throw all that in\n\n57\n00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.119\nhere.\n\n58\n00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.119\nAll right. And it updated it. So here's\n\n59\n00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.560\na few features that actually stood out\n\n60\n00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.920\nto me. So first of all, you have this\n\n61\n00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.600\nselect to edit feature. So rather than\n\n62\n00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.520\ndescribing it, you can just click a\n\n63\n00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.360\nbutton, delete that. If I want to add a\n\n64\n00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.960\nfunctionality to this button, well, I\n\n65\n00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.479\ncan do the same thing. And if you ever\n\n66\n00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.920\nmake some changes and want to just go\n\n67\n00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.439\nback a step, it's really simple. You\n\n68\n00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.439\njust go to one of the previews or you go\n\n69\n00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.439\ninto the version history. And this is so\n\n70\n00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.200\nimportant when you're using AI tools to\n\n71\n00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.959\ncreate stuff. Makes experimenting really\n\n72\n00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.959\neasy for history like this. There's no\n\n73\n00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.800\nrisk to doing that. Okay, so let's say I\n\n74\n00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.400\nlike the content, but I disagree with\n\n75\n00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.400\nthe style. I can just say that make the\n\n76\n00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.760\ndesign more minimalistic with a\n\n77\n00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.360\nbrutalist style. This is something I\n\n78\n00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.800\nwould prefer for my website. Might\n\n79\n00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.080\ndiffer for you, of course.\n\n80\n00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.920\n>> A few moments later.\n\n81\n00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.360\n>> Okay, that looks so much better. So,\n\n82\n00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.720\nlet's say we edit things and go back.\n\n83\n00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.480\nLet's say we like what we see here. And\n\n84\n00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.000\nI could always keep iterating, but I\n\n85\n00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.440\njust want to have this online already.\n\n86\n00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.879\nAll I need to do for that is click\n\n87\n00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.599\npublish. Yeah, that's it. It's live. I\n\n88\n00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.280\ncould get a free custom domain or\n\n89\n00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.959\nconnect one that I already have or just\n\n90\n00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.480\nuse the one that it gives me. To get a\n\n91\n00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.160\nfree domain, I do need a paid plan\n\n92\n00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.680\nthough. Everything else up until now is\n\n93\n00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.840\nfree. And just as a side note, this does\n\n94\n00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.440\ninclude hosting, SSL, CDN, and backups.\n\n95\n00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.040\nIf you don't know what that means, don't\n\n96\n00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.319\nworry about it. You need those things,\n\n97\n00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.080\nand it's all included. And then, as I\n\n98\n00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.000\nmentioned, this is a WordPress website,\n\n99\n00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000\nwhich is like the industry standard for\n\n100\n00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.840\nblogging websites. And that means you\n\n101\n00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.519\ncan also access this for your WordPress\n\n102\n00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.360\ndashboard. I just click this button. You\n\n103\n00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.640\ncan see that there's some blog posts\n\n104\n00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.239\nhere already, and I could do anything\n\n105\n00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.200\nelse like adding media or new pages that\n\n106\n00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.680\nare all editable with this builder. Oh,\n\n107\n00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.040\nand if you really want to go in and make\n\n108\n00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.319\nsome edits, they give you the code\n\n109\n00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.760\neditor, which is something many of these\n\n110\n00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.080\nsites don't do. You can fully customize\n\n111\n00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.840\neverything. Oh, one more thing that's\n\n112\n00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.200\nactually really important. If you want\n\n113\n00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.959\nto add more visuals and images to the\n\n114\n00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.400\nsite, you just need to click one of\n\n115\n00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.560\nthese images and you can upload anything\n\n116\n00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.200\nfrom your machine and voila, that's how\n\n117\n00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.040\nyou add your own media. Quick side note\n\n118\n00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.640\nis that as this is all built on\n\n119\n00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.239\nWordPress, it gets added to the\n\n120\n00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.080\nWordPress media gallery in the back end.\n\n121\n00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.760\nSo, you can reuse these images at any\n\n122\n00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.519\npoint in time in the future. After\n\n123\n00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:40.799\nplaying around a little bit, this is\n\n124\n00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.480\nwhat I got the homepage to look like and\n\n125\n00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.799\nall of that in minutes. Also, Tenweb has\n\n126\n00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.159\nlaunched a white label reseller\n\n127\n00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.480\ndashboard for MSBs, agencies, and\n\n128\n00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.239\nservice companies. So, basically, if you\n\n129\n00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.080\nneed a fully white labelled WordPress\n\n130\n00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.920\nwebsite builder and hosting platform,\n\n131\n00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.440\nand you want a turnkey solution that\n\n132\n00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.280\nworks under your own brand, Tennereb\n\n133\n00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.560\ndoes that too now. So if you're looking\n\n134\n00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.560\nfor a a Toz solution where you get a\n\n135\n00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.799\nwebsite hosting on WordPress which is\n\n136\n00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.280\nideal for SEO with a content management\n\n137\n00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.760\nsystem and a domain and a AI editing\n\n138\n00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.280\ninterface that makes it really easy to\n\n139\n00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.439\nimplement your vision all in one package\n\n140\n00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.040\nthen you should try Tenweb for yourself\n\n141\n00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.879\nand you'll find the website builder from\n\n142\n00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.799\nthe link in the video's description. And\n\n143\n00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.160\nthat's really it. Hope this was useful\n\n144\n00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.440\nto you and I will see you very\n\n"
